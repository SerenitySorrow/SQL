#In this SQL Project, I am querying a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about order data from customers

#1--Amount of orders placed in January
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2--Amount of order in January for only iPhones
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3--Customer Account #'s and orders placed in February
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4--Cheapest product sold in January and its price
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5--Revenue for each product sold in January
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6--Products sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and the total revenue
SELECT sum(Quantity)
,product
,sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7--Average amount spent by customers who ordered more than 2 items in February 
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum) as Customers
,avg(quantity*price) as AmountSpent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN customers cust
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE FEB.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
